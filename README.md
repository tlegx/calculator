A "simple" calculator program written in C#</br>

<summary>If you are in a mood for a read, click here to know the "story" of this "simple" calculator program</summary>
This was, in fact, written by me a while ago (around late 2020). Although this is really interesting to me, I didn't have the time to maintain it. At the time I also didn't know about git so it couldn't be maintained by the community either. Luckily now I am able to bring it back from the dead, after lying unnoticed on my computer. Sadly, it didn't rise and shine, it was incomplete. The whole thing was just a mess I left a while back. You can know more details about it below.

## Using the program
**WARNING: THIS PROGRAM IS INCOMPLETE AND MIGHT NOT FUNCTION CORRECTLY. IN THIS CASE, PLEASE OPEN AN [ISSUE](https://github.com/tlegx/calculator/issues)**

Use it just like your ordinary calculator, with a twist:
- The ^ operator and the square root doesn't exist or didn't work yet.
- The convert menu is basically buttons which does nothing, expect this to work in the next release (maybe)

## Bugs and contributions
As I said, the thing that always "bugs" me is that my program is full of bugs. To help, you can always open an issue and describe in crystal clear what you are facing. Or better yet, feel free to fork this repository and open a pull request.</br>
Saying this everytime is like a YouTuber saying "Like and Subscribe" in every video.
